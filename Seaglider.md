Seagliders are a novel type of maritime vessel that offer high-speed transportation to connect coastal communities.
Seagliders are more efficient, convenient, comfortable, and affordable than existing means of transportation.  
REGENT Craft (Regional Electric Ground Effect Nautical Transport) is the developer and manufacturer of all-electric seagliders.  
There hasn’t been a novel form of transportation in the past 100 years. Today, regional travel is too often slow, inconvenient, uncomfortable, and expensive. With about 40% of the world’s population living near the coast, there’s a pressing need for solutions to quickly and efficiently connect coastal hubs.      

Seagliders are novel high-speed, convenient, all-electric maritime vessels. Seagliders aim to drastically reduce the time and cost of transporting passengers and goods between coastal destinations.
