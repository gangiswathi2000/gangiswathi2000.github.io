The physical and chemical properties of seawater vary according to latitude, depth, nearness to land, and input of fresh water. Approximately 3.5 percent of seawater is composed of dissolved compounds, while the other 96.5 percent is pure water. The chemical composition of seawater reflects such processes as erosion of rock and sediments, volcanic activity, gas exchange with the atmosphere, the metabolic and breakdown products of organisms, and rain. (For a list of the principal constituents of seawater, see seawater: Dissolved inorganic substances.) In addition to carbon, the nutrients essential for living organisms include nitrogen and phosphorus, which are minor constituents of seawater and thus are often limiting factors in organic cycles of the ocean. Concentrations of phosphorus and nitrogen are generally low in the photic zone because they are rapidly taken up by marine organisms. The highest concentrations of these nutrients generally are found below 500 metres, a result of the decay of organisms. Other important elements include silicon (used in the skeletons of radiolarians and diatoms; see Figure 2) and calcium (essential in the skeletons of many organisms such as fish and corals).
